      content: '<p>I&#x27;ve been mostly ambivalent about the Musk-era at Twitter—mostly because I just don&#x27;t care enough to have an opinion.<p>This, though. This one makes me angry and disappointed.<p>Twitter has had such a solid brand for so long. It&#x27;s accomplished things most marketers only dream of: getting a verb like &quot;Tweet&quot; into the standard lexicon is like the pinnacle of branding. Even with all of the issues, &quot;Twitter&quot; and its &quot;Tweets&quot; have been at the core of international discourse for a decade now.<p>Throwing all of that away so Elon can use a domain he&#x27;s sat on since &#x27;99 seems exceedingly foolish.',

It being in the custody of PayPal explains that.',

After all of that, I honestly don&#x27;t think there is a good reason to restrict a name. Maybe the only limit I could think of would be to prove that it is given in good faith and not for some malevolent purpose.',

The reasons SpaceX and to a lesser extent Tesla are the successes they are, is because of the “true believer” leadership it draws. Those endeavours have a clear social-good aspect to them at the “good for humanity” scale. Those endeavours have continue to succeed because Musk’s genius was in hiring them, and in focusing on the regulatory context that allows them to be even more successful. His personal engineering acumen is largely overstated compared to his actual skill set. It also helps that those industries are heavily regulated and those constraints temper his ability to fuck things up.<p>Social media on the other hand doesn’t attract the same kind of believers at that level and there’s no one who cares enough to make it work in spite of him. Being a far less (or barely at all) regulated industry means he’s free to intervene and meddle in the most egregious ways, and the results are obvious for all to see. As a result of Twitter he’ll likely be in lawsuits (from investors, banks etc) for decades. Meantime SpaceX and Tesla will continue to do well. Not because of Musk but in spite of him.',

Facts seem at best that Elon had a good childhood, not much reason to believe greatly &quot;better&quot; than a common well-aligned western family could give.<p>After that, he seems to have been in the position of having to make his own way, while only getting help by a partial investment from his family in a further round of his already-succeeding company that he set up living in his office. So in the positions millions have been. There aren&#x27;t millions of Musks around but there are millions of younger adults that have more than they deserve. But facts don&#x27;t bend for your weird fantasies to be true.<p>Funny thing is, some time ago I thought Elon came from a background where he got a lot of money to start his successes, and still cheered him for making so much more from that than really anyone else. Then people started trying to show in him bad light, which backfired hilariously and now his origin story puts almost anyone to shame.',

Which makes sense, he would probably have gotten less done environmentally and generally if he didn&#x27;t have success of the businesses as clear priority.<p>I think he stated that his underlying big plan was to act in fields that he thinks will have the most impact in the future, being good business while not just profit-driven, after he got the PayPal money (Can&#x27;t find a source right now though) in which he has succeeded, profiting from making the world better, instead, for example, lobbying against ICE&#x27;s and then providing &quot;just-good-enough&quot; Environmental(r) ShittyCars(tm)<p>He also has shifted his focus accordingly when Tesla, and at part, SpaceX, were at dire straits.

My school library was surprisingly well stocked in classic science fiction, which I explored and read a lot of. So I assume it must have also had Heinlein, unless he&#x27;d been &#x27;censored&#x27; because of some of his more radical content but the library did have the <i>Illuminatus</i> trilogy, so I don&#x27;t think so. Did I just never find his books, or did I find them and reject them? It&#x27;s odd, because I pretty much read any science fiction I could find back then.<p>I&#x27;m much less tolerant of science fiction now, to the point of being somewhat intolerant. I often label people as suffering from &#x27;science fiction brain&#x27; and I certainly apply that label to Musk for his beliefs in things like that &#x27;Artificial Intelligence&#x27; is actually possible (I consider it only an idea to play with in books and not ever feasible in reality). That&#x27;s why I found your comment interesting; as an insight to the roots of such a &#x27;science fiction brain&#x27;.',

In a pure engineering discipline, like automotive production or aerospace engineering, they&#x27;re very useful, but neither one of those things necessarily lends itself toward making a thing that is better or more appealing for the populace at large.<p>As an example: The Boring Company. The pure engineering problem of &quot;how do I remove mass from the ground and create a tunnel as cheaply as possible&quot; is a great application of Elon&#x27;s strengths, and a useful problem to work on, because humanity will always need to build tunnels.<p>Hyperloop, though, is completely f&#x27;ing stupid, because regardless of whether an evacuated tube and car system can transport people efficiently or not, almost nobody wants to travel like this, and the entirety of the system is completely inefficient - trains are better in every case and with every metric.<p>In both TBC and Hyperloop, Elon wanted a thing, and convinced people to do it. It&#x27;s just that there was no consideration as to whether the thing Elon wanted was useful or not.<p>This is Twitter. Elon looked at Twitter as a strictly engineering problem. And yes, Twitter was horribly inefficient, as evidenced by the fact that the vast majority of employees were let go and the service mostly continues to function, but my suspicion is that it is riding virtually entirely on H1B employees who are bound  to the job else they are forced to leave the country. People will grind themselves to the bone for advancing human spaceflight and (to a lesser extent, maybe) improving alternative energy, but I don&#x27;t know of any rational person who would do the same for Twitter, even if Elon bills it as the defacto public square.<p>Not to defend Elon, because I can&#x27;t, but to be fair, any person reading this, if they had experienced the successes that Elon has in SpaceX and Tesla, fighting and succeeding against all of the naysayers, would have a non-trivial ego. When you combine that with the echo chamber of Elon&#x27;s fans who treat him like the second coming, and who seem to honestly think that Elon (personally) can fix any problem, is it any wonder that he starts believing some of the bullshit? When he built the sub that led to him calling the rescue diver a pedoguy, and did it because people asked him to, and so many people constantly lauded him with egostroking compliments that he believed he could. And even though he didn&#x27;t do anything that ended up saving those kids, he was found not guilty of defamation, so he still walked away with a win.<p>Fast forward 7 years and when he&#x27;s forced to buy Twitter, he still feels like whatever he does is the right thing, and will do it regardless, and he will convince people under his influence to do what he wants so that he walks away with a win.<p>So that&#x27;s a lot of text to say, yes, you&#x27;re right, it is foolish. He doesn&#x27;t care, he wants to win, and he&#x27;ll do anything he can to walk away with a win, regardless of how it impacts anyone else, because ultimately it&#x27;s not about the people who use the service, it&#x27;s about Elon feeling good about himself.',

I wanted to believe, because I don&#x27;t inherently love driving and love to configure my computer&#x2F;laptop&#x2F;environment such that I can work from any device (thin client-esque) and LOVE the idea of someone else worrying about transportation and me hacking away instead. I&#x27;ll tell you a story about my personal experience delving into making this work.<p>In order from me to get from north of the golden gate bridge in the SF Bay Area (in Marin) to say, Cupertino, which I did regularly when I worked for Rancher Labs and MariaDB, I&#x27;d have had to take 3 separate modes of public transportation which I would need to weave together in a weird way, and was surprisingly expensive. It would also take 4 hours with appropriate adjustments in variation in route timing. Each way. So 8 hours in commute time alone. I didn&#x27;t even try. The route would have been Home -&gt; Ferry -&gt; Walk from Ferry Building to King St -&gt; Caltrain -&gt; Cupertino&#x27;ish, then bus or walk.<p>OKOK, maybe I should have to live closer to take advantage of the marvels of modern public transportation...<p>When I worked at Docker, the Golden Gate transit bus stop was right outside of my house (less than a block.) It was $15 each way. The bus ride took an hour+ and dropped me off 2-6 blocks away, depending on the location of the office at the time. So 1.5 hours each way or 3 hours a day + $30 in fares.<p>Taking the bus was very limiting. Not only did I have to get to the bus at a specific time in the morning, but I had to leave before a certain time at night. What ended up happening was I would take the 5:45am bus, arriving in office around 7:30am and often take the 4pm or 5pm bus back, on average. This was the time I&#x27;d get to the office earlier than everyone, work away for a few hours without anyone there, but also leave earlier than most (but arrive home around the same time)<p>If there was an event in the evening, a spontaneous outing with co-workers, anything, which would happen after work, the busses were no longer running so I had to take the ferry which would take my across the bridge and ask my lovely wife to come pick me up (in a car) from the ferry terminal.<p>The ferry was shorter in terms of travel time (30 mins across the bay) but you have to get there 15 mins early to park and get in line to board and there&#x27;s a variation in the schedule. Factor in potential traffic getting to the ferry terminal, and you&#x27;re leaving to the Ferry 45 minutes prior to departure (for a 30 minutes ride.) So all told it&#x27;s not much better, all in, but I am already in a car, driving. So no car savings in this scenario.<p>Even later  (past 10pm, oh no!) I&#x27;d then I&#x27;ve to call an Uber, and it was incredibly expensive ($120+) in addition to being inconvenient for the Uber driver to have to drive so far away from their normal operating place.<p>I&#x27;ve tried to like Public transit. It was not time efficient or cost efficient in any way for me personally to do any of this. It was far too constraining, despite the benefits.<p>I don&#x27;t think my situation is all too different from most people living outside of a major city or the suburbs of a major city in the united states. Trains and public transportation is definitely not the answer for me. Getting more transportation infrastructure in my area to make it more efficient is not appealing to me in the slightest.<p>HOWEVER, because of all of this, I am such a huge proponent of remote work. Remote work eliminates all of this shit, and, if you don&#x27;t want to have a car or commute or have your car on the road, you don&#x27;t have to.<p>I&#x27;ve put substantially less miles on all of my vehicles since 2020 as a result of the pandemic and the shift from remote work and I could not be happier. I started my truck and drove it for the first time this year today. That&#x27;s <i>amazing.</i>',

I agree with the Strong Towns position that most (or at least many) suburbs are going to become insolvent because of their car-enabled low density. I have no opinions in either direction about remote work generally, but personally I enjoy having an office to work in that isn&#x27;t my home.

Living in Europe with functioning train networks, I can confirm train is much more comfortable than car. Adjusting to a fixed schedule is worth the cost of being much faster and having the time to do something else on the train and be it just relaxation to arrive without exhaustion at the destination.',

The problem you refer to- that public transit cannot service low density- is one which creates itself. Moreover, low-density means low tax revenue and infra is EXPENSIVE; more expensive in many cases than the low-density tax base can support. The net result is that revenue to build infra is generated in high-density areas and then spent on low-density ones, which weakens the public transit offerings in high-density areas and encourages more driving, which encourages more low-density living, and the cycle continues.  This is not sustainable, and something will give eventually.',

Which is a threat to the kinds of people Musk wants to be.<p>Sure, sometimes those public announcements of events were &quot;I hate minorities&quot; or &quot;yo look at my dick&quot;, but the platform was a global notice board that served a positive purpose in that narrow definition.',

          content: '<p>If it&#x27;s deemed foolish, then either Elon is foolish and making a fool of himself, or there&#x27;s a misinterpretation of the action. The success someone like Musk repeatedly attains in business cannot be achieved without a significant capacity for making wise, informed decisions, or strategic moves. If his track record is any indication, he&#x27;ll probably have a successful venture, and I, for one, am fascinated to see the emotional attachment and arrogance the peanut gallery continues to spout. It&#x27;s a curiosity to me why those who have little to no actual stake or insight seem to have the highest confidence and volume. Perhaps it&#x27;s a selection bias.<p>PayPal. SpaceX. SolarCity. Tesla. Boring. Elon Musk has a signature characteristic of building 10x-ethos companies from first principles at great personal &amp; financial risk.<p>It&#x27;s the <i>Muskian Cycle</i>: Innovate, try to garner investment, be laughed out of the room, make it work anyways, laugh all the way to the top of tens of thousands of millions of dollars of net worth. Then stuff all the capital into the next Big Thing.<p>Steve Jobs said something like &quot;Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.&quot; As far as I can tell, each of Musk&#x27;s successful ventures has inculcated iterative or multiplicative innovation into the fabric of technology, society, and interaction.<p>PayPal spearheaded and won the race for payment processing. It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but it was in no small part due to Musk why the company succeeded and earned its eBay buyout.<p>SpaceX, with its obvious contributions to the fields of not only rocketry but every second-order industry around it, including testing&#x2F;software, etc., has been a game-changer. Again, second-order, competition arises, humanity wins.<p>Ditto Tesla; not only the AI&#x2F;ML&#x2F;CV wizardry in the stack but plenty of other non-primary-field innovation and progress comes alongside (manufacturing, battery tech, etc.). I personally am not convinced EVs are some solution to the &quot;climate problem,&quot; given the net-impact of mfg and power consumption, but it is a pre-requisite to self-sustainability that we move toward renewables, and with that optimism I move on.<p>I don&#x27;t know a whole lot about the Solar operations at Tesla, but SpaceX + Starlink has made one of those incremental improvements in the internet access game. I&#x27;ve got my biggest gripe with this venture - based on Kessler Syndrome, I&#x27;m afraid of trashing our space-way by means of junk, though admittedly this fear comes from Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Seveneves&quot; and not facts or reality. Orbital tracking remains a significant challenge to the exploding private space industries.<p>Bringing us to the Boring Co. Literally nobody is complaining about that, but it&#x27;s such a banal and useful and imperative tech to develop for the overall goal of Martian exploration, and it&#x27;s not abstract - it exists and is doing what it needs to do.<p>Certainly 𝕏 (neé Twitter) and Xai are integral to Musk&#x27;s overarching vision. For years, I&#x27;ve posited that someone should, or perhaps already has, been meticulously analyzing the entirety of Twitter&#x27;s data. This data, rich in semantic analysis, interaction templating, linguistics, and more, could be instrumental in training and researching emergent systems. The rapid, mostly unfiltered, and bite-sized nature of the medium provides a unique lens into the human thought process, offering a potential approximation of how &quot;thoughts&quot; might interact.<p>It&#x27;s possible we (humans) are destined to reclaim our collective consciousness through technology. It is also possible Elon is the anti-Christ, and we should be looking inward, meditating, and removing blockages to our lineage that has shrouded the collective consciousness, muted our heart and soul, and reduced us to a low level of being, what the Buddhists might consider Naraka.<p>There are a lot of FUD-spreaders about Neuralink, too, but listening to the technical discussions and grokking the science has me convinced they are approaching another sea change. There are hard engineering problems and there are impossible problems. Elon&#x27;s companies take the hard ones and just work really hard, then get the solution. I see no reason why this approach to software platforms and dynamic interactivity interfaces would be any different.<p>People don&#x27;t like change, and they love to complain about something. So I obviously understand why these &gt; angry and disappointed types are out of the woodwork.<p>But the thing is, we should celebrate and adore the scientific progress, commitment to science &amp; innovation over pure profit, and - in my opinion as a USA chap - dedication to as much free speech as possible.<p>Cringe, hate, love, whatever - the guy is objectively successful and objectively delivered on some cool shit. I wouldn&#x27;t argue he is the most precise or accurate predictor, but he&#x27;s quite the visionary. When the Starship gets to orbit, there&#x27;ll be some more creative press and commentary, but I will be watching and as excited as when the Roadster Spaceman went to Mars. Or when I saw the first booster landings.<p>Everyone fails, we are defined by how hard we try.',

The joke frames itself as if it&#x27;s going to be a defense of the rebrand, but then just goes on to describe an outcome that would be terrible for Elon anyway.<p>---<p>The actual non-joke reality is likely pretty much exactly what you say -- Elon has owned &quot;x.com&quot; for ages and has always wanted to name something &quot;x.com&quot; and he has a grand vision of an everything &quot;brand&quot; that probably mostly just seems cool to him and that he&#x27;s convinced would seem cool to everyone else as well. But he&#x27;s unable to see that to everyone else it just looks like he&#x27;s rebranding into a porn site.<p>He&#x27;s convinced himself that this is a master plan that could lead to his Everything App dominating the Internet. But to everyone else outside of his bubble, the downsides are obvious and the plan just looks silly.<p>And thanks for the book recommendation, I&#x27;ll add it to my list :)<p>----<p>[0]: This is not a criticism of HN, I am myself much more prone to missing jokes than the average person and I regularly rely on context clues to figure out if someone online is joking -- and those context clues are usually missing from HN. So very much no shame to anyone for not catching a joke, I get the confusion and I also regularly miss the exact same jokes.',

Sure, if this play works out and turns to have been undoubtably right, it will be studied for years in buisness schools around the world. But up until that moment, we can be reasonably sure that this isnt one of those exceptionally rare cases',

My belief is that it&#x27;s manic phases caused by bipolar disorder. If you squint and chart these &#x27;manic&#x27; decisions, it seems to be about every 4-5 months. In between he&#x27;ll often (though not always) post some self-reflective and more &#x27;down&#x27; things and be generally more quiet (remember the diet-coke and gun pics?). Then, like with many bipolar sufferers, he&#x27;ll get &#x27;manic&#x27; again and do these kinda things to his businesses and to those around him who care. His personal life is famously a mess.<p>I want to be clear, I&#x27;m not a shrink, I have no degrees in this, and I&#x27;m &#x27;diagnosing&#x27; this very far removed from the guy. But I do have a few bipolar people in my life and, to me, the parallels are very striking.<p>I feel for him in that way. Despite all the money and fame, the disease that I suspect he suffers from (with, again, low evidence) is a very tough one to accept. Of the people in my own life that suffer from it, none have moved past a confirmed diagnosis and started the long road to recovery and acceptance.',

Since he, like so many with bipolar disorder (myself included) is that the cycle of suffering and abhorrent behavior will continue until he can accept that his brain will not let him out of torment long enough to see how his infliction is broadcast outward and who it really effects.  Now combine that with the world’s biggest microphone being used by a man with enough means that it will be dumb luck for him to realize it as he has no consequences for his actions.  It’s not impossible to make that realization on your own and it’s even harder to make it stick without medication to make your brain break out of a cycle that you have no more control over than anyone else, and it’s your own mind doing it to you.',

But for creating a highly successful company <i>twice</i>, luck can&#x27;t be a similarly major explanation, since it isn&#x27;t &quot;bound to happen&quot; that someone who was highly successful once will be highly successful again. Because the number of people with one highly successful company is very small, unlike the number of people with zero highly successful companies. (If you throw a die ten times and get a six ten times, that is massive luck, which means that you almost certainly won&#x27;t manage to do it again.)<p>So when people have one successful company, that may well be partly due to sheer luck, but if so, on their second attempt they almost certainly won&#x27;t be so lucky. That&#x27;s exactly what Jeff Bezos shows with Blue Origin. He started earlier than Musk did with SpaceX, had more money, and still is far less successful.',

Forcing Musk to actually buy Twitter, at a grossly inflated price, was one of the smartest business moves in the past 10 years.<p>I don&#x27;t know, I think the rebranding is a bit silly, but I also think Twitter should have gone bankrupt years ago. Musk paid $44 billion dollars of other peoples money for what was a billion dollar company at best. Trying to turn that around probably require someone as reckless as Elon Musk.<p>The dream of the everything app just seems to fare way. The potential early adopters shy away because it&#x27;s Musk. Unless his own branding (as in &quot;Elon Musk&quot;) is enough to get other businesses to jump onboard I don&#x27;t see how it will ever get off the ground.',

I wonder if they regret it.<p>Although there is one benefit in this story: it shows that Elon Musk is a clown, and as he initially did not want to buy Twitter, it seems like he is taking revenge by destroying it, which is an even better proof.

Imagine the nightmare if it actually had worked as planned.</i><p>The story I&#x27;ve heard is that he wanted to buy a single missile, but regardless.. where is the &#x27;nightmare&#x27; in disarming Russia by buying up all their missiles in a firesale?  It seems doubtful that such purchases would have effectively funded the construction of new missiles since Russia is&#x2F;was so corrupt.  I think the money would have gone into the hands of some oligarchs, and not been invested back into new missile development.<p>Even if that plan had gone through, it would have been child&#x27;s play compared to the ESA and NASA as well as numerous western corporations buying rocket rides from Russia since the mid 90s up to the second Russian invasion of Ukraine a few years ago.  Go down the lists of Proton launches on wikipedia and mouse over each of the payloads, you&#x27;ll see that <i>most</i> of them since the mid 90s have been for American or European organizations.  Even ULA and Orbital Sciences have bought hundreds of engines from Russia and used them to launch US payloads.   I don&#x27;t see many people raking them over the coals for this.  Has this even proven to be a nightmare?  Western money has kept Russia&#x27;s space program alive, but has that funded any successful &#x27;Wunderwaffes&#x27;?  Russia&#x27;s military is still running off the fumes of the Soviet Union and their supposedly amazing wonder weapons either don&#x27;t exist or aren&#x27;t relevant.   Most of that money probably went up their noses.',

              content: '<p>Editable comments and subscriptions predate Musk.<p>Alternative check marks and forcing people to put parody in the account were both caused by the idiotic decision to put blue checkmarks for sale. There&#x27;s no need to conspicuously identify government&#x2F;business accounts as &quot;no really, this is for real&quot; if you haven&#x27;t completely devalued the &quot;no really, this is for real&quot; symbol of your platform. And there&#x27;s no need to put &quot;parody&quot; on an Elon parody account if you can clearly see that it&#x27;s not verified.<p>Are you saying that API restrictions is a good thing? You seem to be suggesting that, but I don&#x27;t know why you&#x27;d feel that way. Revenue sharing just incentivizes inflammatory behavior, which is an obvious net-negative for the platform as a whole. Culling of old accounts is neutral at best.<p>And the DM spam problems were basically unchanged until just the past week when he forced everyone&#x27;s DMs closed. He did manage to introduce new spam problems though, because now every large account&#x27;s replies is full of the most braindead nonsense, just because the user paid $8. I&#x27;ll gladly take crypto spam instead this.<p>Also, the text you quoted said &quot;no product <i>improvements</i>&quot;, but you&#x27;re saying that the product is not &quot;unchanged&quot;. I agree the product has been changed, but I would agree with the GP&#x27;s statement that there haven&#x27;t been <i>improvements</i>.',

That needed to be addressed, likely by being a bit more available (though I don&#x27;t think available to all is the right move), and also by just suspending&#x2F;banning anyone who broke rules badly enough to get their badge taken away. But blasting the doors open and removing a symbol of trust is a pretty clear example of throwing out the baby with the bath water. And I agree more explicit tags are also good, but they became <i>necessary</i> because Elon nuked the previous system. A few <i>gentle</i> changes could have addressed all the problems.<p>The kind of toxicity and algorithmic pushing of content on Twitter isn&#x27;t quite like other platforms. Users are regularly exposed to content from deliberately inflammatory users. Your timeline can be filled with retweets, suggested content, or replies to accounts you don&#x27;t follow by accounts you do. Adding a monetary reward for being inflammatory before addressing the toxicity is the problem. Adding revenue share to Twitter is like throwing money into a mosh pit; it wasn&#x27;t done thoughtfully enough to not make things worse.<p>If Musk wanted to expand revenue share, he could have done it in thoughtful ways. Expanding the subscriptions feature would have been a good start.',

I do agree that one gets more value and depth from longer tweets, but Twitter isn&#x27;t really a place for value and depth, but for shortness and content density. And also, while threads are not really the best UX, they have a very interesting advantage for Twitter: they allow users to engage and amplify the part they find the most interesting, and that drives more engagement than waiting for people to find the interesting part in a five paragraph-long tweet.<p>&gt; Whether it&#x27;s a mistake comes down to how much revenue Twitter makes in blue checkmark fees vs. how much revenue they lost from advertisers bailing. I&#x27;d need to see some hard numbers on that before being able to call it a mistake.<p>Well, we don&#x27;t have the exact numbers but Elon Musk already said that ad revenue fell 50% and cash flow is negative.

These were low-stakes (and arguably low effort) bets taken within a company that was simultaneously having insane success in other departments. The G4 Cube came out between the iMac and the iPod (2 years after the iMac, 1 year before the iPod). That seems like a damn good product-line, and if you could choose any <i>one</i> to miss on, it&#x27;d be the niche prosumer device, not the two consumer devices.<p><i>&gt; Remember NeXT? &gt; Remember he got kicked out of Apple?</i><p>These could be interpreted either way. It seems all part of the larger &quot;Apple story arc&quot;, and more comparable to Tesla&#x27;s shaky middle period, than as binary successes and failures void of any surrounding context. However, I do mean that it could go either way. I wouldn&#x27;t fault someone as judging them as true failures separate from the later Apple success.',

This being HN I don&#x27;t want to get all that political, but I am sure you can think of a few recent US presidents, from both parties, which were seen as quite charismatic and great at speaking, even though they were seen as unconvincing, and downright loathed by many in their opposition. You can find the same situation in many non-political speakers: The magnetism doesn&#x27;t really hit everyone.<p>So someone can be very effective and charismatic while turning off a non-trivial percentage of the people: I&#x27;ve seen this in company executives a whole lot. The people that dislike the CEO will bounce quick, and in the end you end up with a workforce that is very loyal, via self-selection.<p>So is he a talented speaker? Just by by how many people react well to him, the answer is yes, regardless of how well he might convince you or me.',

The trope of the distracted professor, the autistic savant is at least centuries old. He leans into every such trope, and he&#x27;s very careful in cultivating an image of a &quot;founder&quot;, of an &quot;inventor&quot; of an &quot;engineer&quot;. Most people by now know he hasn&#x27;t founded Tesla, or PayPal (was fired from it in fact), he hasn&#x27;t engineered the SpaceX rockets (although he had a hand in those that blew up), and he in fact has no engineering degree despite claiming otherwise.<p>So I&#x27;d say all this means he&#x27;s building this image very intentionally, and he&#x27;s trying to turn his weaknesses into strengths. The more he stutters and repeats, the less we notice how much of what he says is kinda... vapid. Trump has some similar patterns by the way, you can ask him a specific question and he&#x27;ll say he has great ways of answering that, some of the best people told him he has the best answers, his history of a businessman speaks about long experience providing great answers to all kinds of questions... and he won&#x27;t answer your question in the end.<p>Trump and Musk are very different in some ways, but very similar in others.',

Believing that Musk will (or won&#x27;t if you&#x27;re not a fan) be lucky again in his next business <i>because things will fall in Musk&#x27;s favor again</i> is the gambler&#x27;s fallacy - the belief that past events influence future events. No doubt the things Musk can influence will go his way, but there will be things outside of his control that he might not be so lucky with. Even big, important things. Nothing about the gambler&#x27;s fallacy says anything about how trivial or otherwise the lucky events are.',

Do it 3 times (1&#x2F;100)^3?<p>It’s easier to do when you can be bailed out by friends and family after the first failure, compared to people who end up sleeping on the street. Considering that even succeeding once is a rare event, it is not that surprising that the final population is heavily skewed.<p>&gt; Maybe the general idea was nor bad and he got lucky in recruitment? Recruiting young people believing in his idea and getting overworked to reach them?<p>There is certainly a bit of that. And to be fair, it is the best strategy: a single human has only so much bandwidth them handling all the aspects of a large-ish company is a recipe for disaster. Not to mention, a single point of failure, so the company’s dead the moment anything happens to them. It’s been the same with Jobs, one of his talents was to hire the right people.',

He seems much stronger in physical areas like rockets can cars though, not software.<p>(2) He doesn&#x27;t listen to pessimists and nihilists who say things are impossible if, when reasoning from first principles, they can be shown to be quite possible. Example: ignoring people who said you can&#x27;t land a rocket or that an EV could never do well in the market.

I.e., plenty of &quot;thinking differently&quot; (which can be very valuable, and Musk has had some notable successes here and there), but not enough &quot;filter&quot;.<p>I would say, though, that as his value** has fluctuated on the technical side (and, I personally have the sense has likely never been that high), he did build some real strength in &quot;branding&quot; and selling &#x2F; marketing. He created &#x2F; built a personal brand, especially, that was quite important in raising money &#x2F; funding for R&amp;D etc. at SpaceX and Tesla, especially.<p>Ultimately, his arc is ... an archetype. His arc is a great example of a pattern that is seen frequently (enough) among ambitious people who become very successful through drive, risk-taking &#x2F; (some degree of) unconventional thinking, etc. You see this with people like George Lucas, and part of it is the &quot;yes men&quot; trope alluded to in another comment.<p>Basically, early in their careers, their impulses and &quot;visions&quot; and the like are tempered by others and organizational structures of various types. This tempering is a key additional filter which helps keep their creativity and problem-solving skills etc. more focused &#x2F; ~&quot;pointed in the right direction&quot;. But, over time, they gain more and more power - more and more freedom to do what <i>they</i> want, to not have to listen to anyone else.

I remember when the &#x27;anti-zuckerburg&#x27; campaign of HNers and the media all screamed and attempted to prothesize the death of Meta Platforms when it&#x27;s stock plunged to $90.<p>Even before the layoffs, Zuckerberg was the &#x27;villain&#x27; somehow and is somehow called by the most angriest of people a &#x27;Nazi&#x27;. Now it is 200% up in less than a year and now the media&#x27;s opinions have changed like the weather and are now cheering him again.<p>Today, Elon is somehow now the &#x27;villain&#x27; of the year because of the layoffs and buying Twitter and now they are even angrier that Twitter &#x2F; X did not &#x27;die&#x27; immediately before 2023 as incorrectly predicted. So every speed bump Elon makes to Twitter &#x2F; X is now 100x magnified from now on by the media.<p>Either way, the predictions of both the deaths of Twitter &#x2F; X and Meta Platforms by the media and on HN has always been greatly exaggerated.',

He is meme-style trying to enjoy the blunder he made while having a tiny but an exponential chance he still may hit it big by doing something outright crazy such as his long-time aspiration of  x.com (the everything company). He is finding out currently that social-human systems work very differently than engineering systems, and he is not very talented at all on the human side of things. Don‘t take him too seriously just as he doesn‘t take himself all that seriously either. And hey, there‘s always the upshot opportunity of it going big, but that is a tiny chance by know.<p>To me it looks like everyone who‘s trying to take him seriously by now with all this are making themselves laughing stock. And Musk couldn‘t care less.<p>For me the only problem is that I‘m a Tesla shareholder and I‘ve seen a sort of dilution and all his suffering first-hand, where a single share of mine has already turned into 15 since I bought it. Thus of course I have skin in the game, but I still consider this all as a big meme-like joke.<p>Soon we‘re all dead anyway, so let‘s not think about things too serious and money is just money for most people who have it. It‘s no bigger than life. Have fun and enjoy the ride, our 100 years on this planet are a sliver so we‘ll all be enjoying it in our own messed up ways.

X windows is sometimes distributed by this secret consortium free of charge to unsuspecting victims. The destructive cost of X cannot even be guessed.<p>X is truly obese — whether it’s mutilating your hard disk or actively infesting your system, you can be sure it’s up to no good. Innocent users need to be protected from this dangerous virus. Even as you read this, the X source distribution and the executable environment is being maintained on hundreds of computers, maybe even your own.<p>Digital Equipment Corporation is already shipping machines that carry this dreaded infestation. It must be destroyed.<p>This is what happens when software with good intentions goes bad. It victimizes innocent users by distorting their perception of what is and what is not good software. This malignant window system must be destroyed.<p>Ultimately DEC and MIT must be held accountable for this heinous <i>software crime</i>, brought to justice, and made to pay for a <i>software cleanup</i>. Until DEC and MIT answer to these charges, they both should be assumed to be protecting dangerous software criminals.<p>Don’t be fooled!

Make up some goofy nonsense word. Make up a phony sounding &quot;foreign&quot; word if you have to (Starbucks cup sizes, etc.) I&#x27;m fine with all of that!

He has successfully failed upwards his entire career and bought into his own hype. This isn&#x27;t new. He was ousted from Paypal for incompetence.<p>What fooled a lot of people (including me) was SpaceX but it&#x27;s become clear that SpaceX has succeeded in spite of Elon, not because of him. Someone in the SpaceX leadership has done an exceptional job of insulating SpaceX from Elon&#x27;s terrible and random micromanagement. Some might say Tesla. I think the jury is still out on Tesla. The business doesn&#x27;t justify its market cap but irrational hype can last a very long time. Just look at Bitcoin.<p>Eventually these fail-sons make a bet so large it costs them everything. It&#x27;s why wealth rarely lasts more than a few generations. It&#x27;s why the wealthiest people in America aren&#x27;t named Astor, Vanderbilt, Rockefeller, Morgan or Carnegie. Eventually some fail-son destroyed the fortune their forebears built.<p>Elon wants to turn Twitter into WeChat, basically. An all-encompassing destination and platform. Chat, banking, etc.<p>Elon has done the Mckinsey or Private Equity thing of just raising prices and cutting costs without regard for long-term consequences. His actions have caused a huge drop in advertiser revenue, one that won&#x27;t be recouped at $8&#x2F;month. He has to come up with the money to cover interest payments and the Tesla board and shareholders have limited patience for him selling Tesla stock to do it. Should Tesla crater, Elon could well go under.<p>To paraphrase something I saw on Twitter (sorry, &quot;X&quot;), Elon has thrown away a 15 year old household name for a delete button.',

From that agnosticism, then, we can build a framework of expectations. And that is entirely elective - if you want to say that nobody is exceptional, you&#x27;ll seek to reinforce that.

Granted he seems to be off on a very weird tangent with Twitter and it will be interesting to see where it leads, but it would be dumb to just dismiss him as a childless out of control billionaire (seriously?).<p>There was zero way Twitter could have survived on the path it was going; if not for drastic changes he instituted - mainly in dramatically cutting costs and overhead - they would have been dead anyway.  They are no longer bleeding.  They have lots of debt, thus they still need to do something new to pay it off, but at least they aren&#x27;t accruing more debt like they were before.<p>Twitter was a niche player anyway - it was disproportionately used by techies but was far from having a broad penetration so why not move in a bold, new direction?  Its current model is already known to be untenable long term - even before Elon bought them.<p>The real issue is ads are no longer going to be enough to sustain the tech giants (ads were mostly a scam of bot farmed clicks, over promised results, etc.).  I wouldn&#x27;t worry about Twitter now X - it will survive, whether this crowd feels it&#x27;s for them or not.  What I&#x27;m really interesting in seeing is how Google, Facebook and others are going to remain relevant.  In the near term I would expect layoffs to accelerate since that&#x27;s the lowest hanging fruit for these companies, but at some point they are likely going to have to come up with something more substantial and of actual value.',

Each individual engineer is responsible for a very small and well-defined problem that can be solved using skills that are taught at thousands of universities around the world.

That&#x27;s why 135 shuttle missions were flown with 5 shuttles instead of 135 shuttles.   It&#x27;s true that refurbishment between use was far more expensive and time consuming than had been planned, however it was a hell of a lot cheaper than building a new shuttle each time.   Refurbishing a shuttle took months but building Endeavour to replace Challenger took several years and cost several orders of magnitude more.  There can be no serious question that the shuttle orbiters were mostly reusable.<p>&gt; cost effective<p>That&#x27;s another matter entirely.  It would have been cheaper to use conventional disposable rockets.  Even better than that is reusable conventional rockets; the economic sense of which has now been demonstrated by Falcon 9.',

Nabbing a Soviet spy satellite would probably be suicide, they could have easily had scuttling charges onboard that would destroy both the satellite and the shuttle.<p>What is known is that it was designed to go to a polar orbit, where many spy satellites are, deploy a satellite and return to the launch site after a single orbit.  It&#x27;s that &quot;single orbit&quot; part that particularly necessitates the large cross-range capability, since 90 minutes later the launch site will about 1500 miles to the east of where it was.  If landing after a single launch weren&#x27;t necessary, they could just orbit for a day and wait for the landing sight to come around again.  Deploying a satellite in a single orbit would be an incredible feat, but capturing one in a single orbit is just too far-fetched.<p>The idea of doing this was apparently to launch a US spy satellite quickly without giving the Soviets much time to track the exact orbital parameters the satellite was being deployed into.  TBQH it doesn&#x27;t make a whole lot of sense to me, unless the spy satellites themselves are presumed to be stealthy to Soviet radars.  Maybe that was the case.  I can see why the Soviets thought it was a nuclear bomber.  Anyway, the Shuttle never actually went to polar orbit at all, so in this sense you could say the Shuttle never fulfilled its purpose.',

Now that users and advertisers are fleeing and news sites are using Twitter sources less, he may as well bury the site, as it&#x27;s outlived its usefulness to him.',

I don&#x27;t even post on twitter, I read, so I&#x27;m not giving the perspective of an active twitter participant, but tbh 99% of non-blue-check twitter participants only <i>cost</i> twitter money, are dumb and their accounts should be nuked from orbit. Their only purpose was to make the room feel crowded, and thus to attract more broke users. Not that most of blue check twitter isn&#x27;t terrible, but that&#x27;s the terrible that people are actively looking for. Terrible with a fanbase.<p>So, in the future, you should be paying for twitter or have an account at least a year or two old in order to harass journalists, politicians, and people you watch on television.

I recommend trying wengrow and graeber’s Dawn of Everything or their academic papers. Understood it’s extreme to you. The writing’s there if you have the want to see it.<p>“We live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable – but then, so did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings.”<p>However besides just sharing that Graeber and Wengrow have documented realities in human history that explored answers to your question (and post discovery of agriculture, and scaled beyond dunbar&#x27;s number), I&#x27;ll also share this alternative response from Graeber&#x27;s earlier works that predate a lot of the really exciting anthro and archaeological discoveries in recent years (the cutting edge research covered in their last book and papers):<p>“Normally, when you challenge the conventional wisdom—that the current economic and political system is the only possible one—the first reaction you are likely to get is a demand for a detailed architectural blueprint of how an alternative system would work, down to the nature of its financial instruments, energy supplies, and policies of sewer maintenance. Next, you are likely to be asked for a detailed program of how this system will be brought into existence. Historically, this is ridiculous. When has social change ever happened according to someone’s blueprint? It’s not as if a small circle of visionaries in Renaissance Florence conceived of something they called “capitalism,” figured out the details of how the stock exchange and factories would someday work, and then put in place a program to bring their visions into reality. In fact, the idea is so absurd we might well ask ourselves how it ever occurred to us to imagine this is how change happens to begin.”',

Elon just doesn&#x27;t like it.<p>Censored in Türkiye because like every other platform he will crumble to government pressures.<p>He&#x27;s doing the same shit that he tried to call out in the &quot;Twitter Files&quot;, the ONLY difference is which views he supportive of compared to say Zuck.<p>And overall it&#x27;s fine with me.

If we&#x27;re only looking at what is considered free speech in the US then Twitter had completely free speech before Elon took over. My usage of illegal content was in response to the claim that there were no laws around censorship in the US. Clearly there is, and you agree; Illegal content does need to be censored.

If so, they aren&#x27;t an absolutist.<p>I wasn&#x27;t making a claim on whether or not that was reasonable content to take action on.<p>&gt; CIS IS a slur.<p>No, it&#x27;s not.

Elon says thats going to get banned, and that&#x27;s not a free speech issue for some reason. But when people bring up the usage of the N-word or anti-Semitic language, Elon is oddly quiet. Again, I guess that is fine, it&#x27;s his platform, but clearly slurs aren&#x27;t wholesale banned, so then how is that free speech? Oh, right, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s the exact same as Facebook or Reddit or any other website. As if Elon isn&#x27;t doing anything unique but selling you on the idea that he is.',
